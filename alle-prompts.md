## Sesjon 1: App-utvikling

### 1.
```
so now I have those two dropdowns in the menubar which is great. but the projects are sorted alphabetically, not chronologically. I want the latest one on top.
```

### 2.
```
also I want the ones that are actually building, and have just finished building. so all the ones I'm working ob today to show in a separate section on top of those dropdowns, so I don't need to think cercel or netfliy - i can have a build running in vercel and in netlify at the same time, and see both of them on the top.
```

### 3.
```
open it in xcode so we can rebuild the new version
```

### 4.
```
or can you do that from commandline
```

### 5.
```
one issue I have now is that the indicator shows red when the error is not the latest build but before that - and it's not actually a build error, it's just that it skipped deploy / canceled deploy because it was part of a monorepo with no cchanges - any ideas on how to improve on this?
```

### 6.
```
i rebuilt and it still shows a red indicatior for this older skipped build  try and figure it out?
```

### 7.
```
dropdown correctly showing grey skipped - menubar indicator still showing red
```

### 8.
```
add the changelog skill and slash command as it's used here '/Users/simonsouyrisstrumse/Claude Code Projects/Vibecoding-no-ny-side' but its own implementation here and boostrap it with all known changelogs
```

### 9.
```
brainstorm great names for this app - base yourself maybe on some of the research you did and what names work great on product hunt
```

### 10.
```
yes - also do the research on the shipshape branding, best domains available etc.
```

### 11.
```
what does this app have that shiplog doesn't have? I'm tempted to just download and use shiplog instead of this one. actually do install it for me so I can test them side by side
```

### 12.
```
ok. mine is actually better. go back to planning the domain and branding for shipshape but also look at if we can add these to our very neat ui withput bloating it or adding any lines etc. be smart about it
```

### 13.
```
is there a way we can fetch the exact building cycle, or notify as soon as it's done building? more often polling (poll more often just after it's detected a build started, and until build finished  or for 2 minutes after build started...) other ideas? will i need a different setup to get these options Zeitgeist
👁 An iOS and iPadOS app for keeping an eye on your Vercel deployments

Welcome to the Zeitgeist repository! Zeitgeist is an iOS and iPadOS client for browsing your Vercel projects and deployments. It's built using SwiftUI and takes advantage of the iOS 15 and 16 SDKs to offer:

Real-time updates via background push notifications
Refreshable views
Server-side filtering of deployments
Lock Screen and Home Screen widgets
 also please write down your marketing plan and next steps to a .md
```

### 14.
```
why do I suddenly have no accounts connected in the latest version? how did this happen?
```

### 15.
```
vercel is showing 20 projects and netlify 38 - but i know vercel has way more. why only showing 20? I don't mean that I want to show more. i just want to know if it's a limitation put on our end or their end
```

### 16.
```
yes add limit 100 but show only top 20 in the first view of the dropdown, with maybe a view more at the end of the list
```

### 17.
```
initialize git and github
```

### 18.
```
ok. great. now bring back up the marketing plan
```

### 19.
```
what about getshipshape or something like that. more frequently used
```

### 20.
```
update the marketing plan with shipshape.it
```

### 21. ⭐ VENDEPUNKT
```
ok. now how many of the: next steps list can you do autonomously or semiautonomously using the chrome extension, remotion skill web searches to learn how to best solve thise problems with claude code, and screenshots and whatever. Let's see you ship it
```

## Sesjon 2: Lansering

### 22.
```
can you use remotion skills - and send out some subagents to learn how people use claude code to build great remotion videos - and then make me a promovideo using remotion?
```

### 23.
```
regarding the video - this text is not very visible when it is on top of the product showing things are badly alligned here  all in all the video itself is good, but stuff is a bit small, tags and texts and things are a bit small- maybe you can alling things better - make sure all text is more visible etc and make a new version - could you also venerate and add music to it
```

### 24.
```
here is the screenshot Desktop/ScreenshotOrganizer/inbox/Screenshot 2026-02-04 at 15.40.10.png' and here is a video you can turn into a gif '/Users/simonsouyrisstrumse/Desktop/ScreenshotOrganizer/inbox/Screen Recording 2026-02-04 at 15.45.14.mov'
```

### 25.
```
and and then render and export the video for me
```

### 26.
```
ok. can you now use remotion to make a video demo of the product - like what you wanted to have in the gif. make a remotion video that just shows how the product works and turn this into a gif´
```

### 27.
```
ok. what are we missing for launch now?
```

### 28. ⭐
```
yes do all of that feel free to search the web to get design inspirations from our best competitors, screenshot their designs and build us a unique and superior design but inspired by what they thought about
```

### 29.
```
cant you do this? To Deploy to GitHub Pages

  After pushing to GitHub, enable Pages in your repo settings:

  1. Go to Settings → Pages
  2. Under "Source", select Deploy from a branch
  3. Choose main branch and /docs folder
  4. Click Save
```

### 30.
```
this is so awesome - now in this session and chat you almost automated shipping a full product with claude code - after making the product in a few prompts with me on my spec you created the videos, the gifs, the website, the copy, the marketing copy etc. and even prepped a lot of things for product hun. I'm sure I missed somethings even here. oplease document it all both in like an .md for use int he future tor replicate the orocess, but also as an article, with a linkein post that goes with it where you brag a bit about how we did it, and show what kind of prompts and methods we used to get there.
```

### 31.
```
i can't find the article and linkedin posts. can you open them for me?
```

### 32.
```
make a short story talking about how it maed all the marketing material, all the marketing strategy and then how it shipped itself
```

### 33.
```
dette er jo litt outline på linkeding + andre plattformer historien jeg vil fortelle Jeg gjorde et veldig kult eksperiment i dag. Ga claude code en retning og en visjon. Den bygde Mac appen på et prompt - deretter etter et promptmarkdesføringsvideo, nettside, screenshots, animerte Gifer, linkedincreenshots, animerte Gifer, linkedin posts, og lanserte seg selv… så fra ide til lansering i 3-4 (veldig korte prompt) kan du skrive den med riktig kontekst som er her
```

### 34.
```
også husk å deploye landingssiden til vercel - gjør de siste next stepsene for lansering
```

### 35.
```
med ekte lenke til dmg-en
```

### 36.
```
eller githuben ihvertfall
```

### 37.
```
kan du dokumentere alle promptene jeg skrev i dette prosjektet fra den første til den siste?
```

### 38.
```
men har du nøyaktig det jeg skrev?
```
